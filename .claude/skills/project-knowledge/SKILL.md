# project-knowledge

## Purpose

Progressively accumulate project knowledge discovered during development. Incremental additions as new facts are discovered.

## Trigger

Activate when project investigation findings need to be recorded, or when invoked by other skills.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following directories and files exist. Create them if missing:

```bash
mkdir -p wiki/knowledge/discoveries
touch wiki/knowledge/architecture.md
touch wiki/knowledge/conventions.md
touch wiki/knowledge/dependencies.md
touch wiki/knowledge/gotchas.md
```

If any of the category files are newly created (empty), initialize them with a header:
- `architecture.md` → `# Architecture\n`
- `conventions.md` → `# Conventions\n`
- `dependencies.md` → `# Dependencies\n`
- `gotchas.md` → `# Gotchas\n`

## Workflow

1. **Read existing knowledge**
   - Read all files in `wiki/knowledge/` to check for duplicates

2. **Classify the knowledge**
   - Determine the appropriate category:
     - `architecture` — Components, layers, patterns, data flow
     - `conventions` — Naming rules, coding style, file organization
     - `dependencies` — Packages, versions, external services
     - `gotchas` — Pitfalls, workarounds, non-obvious behavior

3. **Record**
   - If it fits an existing category: **append** to that file (never overwrite existing content)
   - If it's a standalone discovery: create `wiki/knowledge/discoveries/{NNNN}.md` using the template below

4. **Verify output**
   - Confirm the knowledge was written (file exists, new content appended)
   - Confirm it's not a duplicate of existing entries

## Category Append Format

When appending to a category file, use this format:

```markdown

## {Discovery Title} ({YYYY-MM-DD})

{Specific finding}

- Evidence: {which code/file/config confirmed this}
- Impact: {how this affects future work}
```

## Discovery Template

For standalone discoveries in `wiki/knowledge/discoveries/{NNNN}.md`:

```markdown
# {Discovery Title}

> Category: {architecture|conventions|dependencies|gotchas}
> Discovered: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm}
> Context: {What task led to this discovery}

## Content

{Specific finding}

## Evidence

{Which code/file/config confirmed this}

## Impact

{How this knowledge affects future work}
```

## Output

All output MUST be written under `wiki/` only:
- `wiki/knowledge/{category}.md` — Appended knowledge
- `wiki/knowledge/discoveries/{NNNN}.md` — Standalone discovery

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Knowledge is not a duplicate of existing entries
- [ ] Knowledge was appended to the correct category or created as new discovery
- [ ] Content is specific and evidence-based (not vague)

## Rules

- ALL documentation output goes under `wiki/` — nowhere else.
- wiki/ files are append-only. Never modify or delete existing content.
- Check existing files before adding to avoid duplicates.
- Prefer appending to category files over creating standalone discoveries.
